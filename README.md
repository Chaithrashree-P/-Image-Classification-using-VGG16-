# -Image-Classification-using-VGG16-
This repository showcases an image classification application utilizing the VGG16 model, a deep convolutional neural network known for its effectiveness in visual recognition tasks. VGG16 is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, making it a robust starting point for transfer learning. In this project, we demonstrate how to fine-tune VGG16 to classify images into predefined categories. The implementation leverages Keras with TensorFlow as the backend, providing an accessible approach to advanced image classification techniques.
